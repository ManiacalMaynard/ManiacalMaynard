Hey o, I‚Äôm @ManiacalMaynard
 
Coming from a long graphic design career, I'm finally learning how to write organically rather than copy/pasta =)

I am working on learning to develop a deeper understanding of front end development to compliment my skills in UX, UI, SEO, and general design.

Currently learning JavaScript with an eye toward Python next. 

Very much looking forward to actively contribute to open source and other non-profit-motive projects soon. If you have a suggestion on projects that I can contribute to, please let me know!

maynard at maniacalindustries (dotcom), cheers! üçª
