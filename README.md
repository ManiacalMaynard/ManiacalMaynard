##"Learn how, and make it rad"

Hey o, I‚Äôm @ManiacalMaynard! A highly driven, self-taught web developer who is voracious for new know-how.

If you have a suggestion on projects that I can contribute to, amazing brownie recipes, or just want to chat about Dune please let me know! maynard at maniacal industries (dotcom), cheers! üçª
