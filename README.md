- 👋 Hi, I’m @ManiacalMaynard
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to develop a more deep understanding of code for website, apps, etc. Coming from a long graphic design career, I'm finally learning how to write organically rather than copy/pasta =)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript with an eye toward Python next.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any web project really. Willing to learn.
- 📫 How to reach me maynard at maniacalindustries (dotcom), cheers!
