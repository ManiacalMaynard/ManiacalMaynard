Hey o, I‚Äôm @ManiacalMaynard
 
Coming from a long graphic design career, I'm finally learning how to code organically rather than simply copy/pasta'ing =) Very much looking forward to actively contribute to open source and other non-profit-motive projects soon.

Currently learning JavaScript with an eye toward Python next.  My goal is to develop a deeper understanding of front end development to compliment my skills in UX, UI, SEO, and general visual design.

If you have a suggestion on projects that I can contribute to, amazing cookie recipes, or just want to chat please let me know! maynard at maniacalindustries (dotcom), cheers! üçª
