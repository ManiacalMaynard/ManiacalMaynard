Hey o, I‚Äôm @ManiacalMaynard

"Learn how, and make it rad". I am a highly driven self-taught web developer who is voracious for new know-how. My goal is to develop a deep understanding of full stack development to add to my skills in UX, UI, SEO, and visual design to become a more well rounded maker of web experiences.

If you have a suggestion on projects that I can contribute to, amazing brownie recipes, or just want to chat about Dune please let me know! maynard at maniacal industries (dotcom), cheers! üçª
