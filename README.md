Hey o, I‚Äôm @ManiacalMaynard
 
Coming from a long graphic design career I am turning my attention to front end web development where I am learning how to code organically, from scratch. Very much looking forward to actively contribute to open source and other non-profit-motivated projects soon.

My goal is to develop a deeper understanding of front end development to add to my skills in UX, UI, SEO, and general visual design to become a more well rounded maker of web experiences.

If you have a suggestion on projects that I can contribute to, amazing brownie recipes, or just want to chat please let me know! maynard at maniacalindustries (dotcom), cheers! üçª
